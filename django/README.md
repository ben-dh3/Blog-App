Hey there, if you are reading this you are either gfg club member or a friend of mine. Thank you so much for even looking at this.

I created this project in Django with python3. It is a simple Blogging website with the most basic frontend you would ever see in life. The main motive to create this project in Django and not in Golang was because i dont know how to build a backend project from scratch in Golang. Plus i was curious as how does Django works and wanted to understand its working and environment.

I learnt a lot from this project. I got to know that how much a file structure is important and what settings means what.

For running this Project:

* Clone this repository.
* Inside the Django server you would find a file named "bin".
* Run this command - "source bin/activate". This will start your environment.
* After this, go inside src file, then mysite file then you will see a manage.py file there. Simpily run this command - "python3 manage.py runserver". This will start running your application on localhost(I knew the answer of the localhost question asked by the gfg person :) 
*  Time for my hostel attendance, thanks for visiting :)
